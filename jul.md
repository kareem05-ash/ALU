3. CLI (Command Line Instruction)
    - Youtube Course (El-Zero Web School): 10 videos
    - Uses CLI (cmder): to setup my new repos on GitHub or manage my local pc
4. Powerfull TBs for my *Verilog* Projects
    - I've learnt how to write a powerfull testbench for my design and fix bugs
    - I made a sequence for my to write my testbenches and it's so good for someone didn't learn, how to verfy designs
    - All of that, it's before the **Verification Workshop** which I'll attend the next month
5. Intro to Python 
    - Youtube Course (El-Zero Web School): 152 videos 
    - I just, watched only 30 videos
    - I know it's not even good, but it's the start and I'll go forward the next month(ÿßŸÜ ÿ¥ÿßÿ° ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá)
    - I went through basics and data types
6. Microsoft Office

## üöß What I Started but Didn't Finish    

1. Youtube Course (El-Zero Web School): 152 videos
    - My Goal was : 100 videos
    - Achieved is : 30 videos
2. NTI Course (Python)
    - I just, tackled the attendace but, I didn't hand in any task
    - I just, handed in the grad project hoping to get the certificate
    - All of this happened because the course was truly under expectations
    - This makes me lazy 
    - This makes me choose [Youtube Course (El-Zero Web School): 152 videos] to learn **Python**
3. Youtube Channel
    - My Goal was : build my youtube channel
        - Share a small **Demos** for my projects in English

## üß† Projects      

1. RISC-V RV23I Single Cycle Proccessor [GitHub Repo](github.com/kareem05-ash/RISC_32I)
2. Integer CLK Division with (odd, even) divisor [GitHub Repo](github.com/kareem05-ash/Integer_Clk_Division)
3. Traffic Light Controller with (main, side) road and parameters (green, yellow) signal life time [GitHub Repo](github.com/kareem05-ash/Traffic_Light_Controller)
4. UART-IP RX, TX, and FIFOs. Fully Parametrized [GitHub Repo](github.com/kareem05-ash/UART_IP)
5. PWM_Timer Core with slow_clk generator(Integer clk division) and WB_Interface [Github Repo](github.com/kareem05-ash/Hackathon)
6. Debugging Reference for Common **Verilog** Bugs [GitHub Repo](github.com/kareem05-ash/Debugging_Reference-Veriog-)

## ‚ùó Challenges I Faced    

1. UART_IP project
    - It was truly confussing
    - I've built its RX, TX over 3 times from scratch
    - I've spent on it alot of hours for debugging 
    - Thanks to God, it's almost done I just will go through *Vivado* flow, and document it
2. NTI Course (Python)
    - It takes 6 hours a day
    - It takes 5 days a week
    - The level was very bad and the instructor was so bad
3. PWM_Timer Core has handed in 48 hours only
    - It was a very useful experience to work under this pressure in a team consists of 4 members only 
    - It was so impressive to be a teamleader and the work is handed as much as we can perfict
